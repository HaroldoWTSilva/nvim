# My personal NeoVIM config repo

Keeping my configs coherent among different development machines.

## Install

Install [tree-sitter-cli](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/releases) 
and [hack nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).

I'm using phpactor as PHP LSP and lua-language-server as Lua LSP.

Then

```bash
apt install nodejs npm
```

Then git clone this into the ~/.config/ folder, or into whatever your neovim 
config directory is.
